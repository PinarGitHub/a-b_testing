# **AB TESTING PROJECT**

### **BUSINESS PROBLEM**:  A social media  company recently introduced a new type of bidding ,average bidding, as an alternative to existing maximum bidding. One of our customers decided to test this new feature and wants to implement A/B Test in order to see whether average bidding brings more revenue than maximum bidding.  

### **STORY OF THE DATASET**: In "ab_testing.xlsx" dataset, which includes website information of the customer, there is information such as the number of advertisements that users see and click, as well as earnings information from here.

### We have two groups in the dataset as control group and test group

### **ATTRIBUTES**:

#### - Impression: Number of ad views
#### - Click: Indicates the number of clicks on the displayed ad
#### - Purchase: Indicates the number of products purchased after the ads clicked
#### - Earning: Earnings after purchased products
